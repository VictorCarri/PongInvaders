   Assumptions: No Assumptions <br><br>
   
   State Variables: 
   <br>
  handler:Handler<br>
  reference to Handler class<br>
  ref : String<br>
  no ball sprite; however needs to be referenced as Pong is a child of Game Object <br>
   x: float<br>
   Is the x-position of ball on window<br>
   y: float<br>
   Is the y-position of ball on window<br>
   id: enumeration<br>
   Is the identification of which class is being referred to<br>
   velX: float<br>
   Is the velocity of ball in the x-direction<br>
   velY: float<br>
   Is the velocity of ball in the y-direction<br>
   Clamp: Game<br>
   Sets the bounds to which the ball can travel to on the window<br>
   tempObject : GameObject<br>
   Is a temporary Object of GameObject which then allows traversal of Linked List in Handler<br>
   intersects: Rectangle<br>
   Checks if hit boxes of two objects have intersected<br> 
   g: Graphics<br>
   allows graphics to be drawn on to screen<br>
   HEIGHT:Game<br>
   Give height of game window<br>
   WIDTH:Game<br>
   Give width of game window<br>
   get : Handler<br>
   gets index of Object in Linked list<br>
   size : Handler<br>
   gets size of Linked list<br>
   setColor: Graphics<br>
   Sets a color of the ball<br>
   fillRect : Graphics<br>
   Creates a box which will be ball<br>
   alienKillCount: Bullet<br>
   Gets the count of aliens that have died<br>
   SetY:GameObject<br>
   Sets the y-position of ball on the window<br>
   dy: float<br>
  change in y-direction used to calculate which velocity ball will have<br>
  AIDefeat: boolean<br>
  check if AI has lost<br>
  PlayerDefeat :boolean
  checks if player has lost<br>
  g: Graphics<br>
  allows graphics to be drawn on to screen<br>
    <br>
   
   Environment  Variables: <br>
   None<br><br>
   
   Access Routine Semantics: <br>
   Ball():<br>
   transition: Initializes reference to Sprite, x position y position and ID of Ball, and this instance of handler  <br>
   tick():<br>
   transition: Allows game objects to be placed in game loop <br>
   collision():<br>
   transition: Checks if ball hits alien,or ball controlled paddle or, AI controlled paddle<br>
   render():<br>
   transition: Will render object to screen <br>
   getBounds():<br>
   transition: Gets bounds of the ball to set up for collision <br>
