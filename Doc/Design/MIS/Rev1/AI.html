   Assumptions: No Assumptions <br><br>
   
  
  State Variables:
   <br>
  handler:Handler<br>
  reference to Handler class<br>
  ball: Ball<br>
  reference to Ball class<br>
  ref : String<br>
  no paddle sprite; However needs to be referenced as AI is a child of Game Object <br>
   x: float<br>
   Is the x-position of AI paddle on window<br>
   y: float<br>
   Is the y-position of AI paddle on window<br>
   id: enumeration<br>
   Is the identification of which class is being referred to<br>
   velX: float<br>
   Is the velocity of AI paddle in the x-direction<br>
   velY: float<br>
   Is the velocity of AI paddle in the y-direction<br>
   Clamp: Game<br>
   Sets the bounds to which the AI paddle can travel to on the window<br>
   intersects: Rectangle<br>
   Checks if hit boxes of two objects have intersected<br> 
   g: Graphics<br>
   allows graphics to be drawn on to screen<br>
   setColor: Graphics<br>
   Sets a color of the paddle<br>
   fillRect : Graphics<br>
   Creates a box which will be paddle<br>
   paddle2Ycenter: float
   gets value of middle of paddle
   tempObject : GameObject<br>
   Is a temporary Object of GameObject which then allows traversal of Linked List in Handler<br>
    <br>
   
   Environment  Variables: <br>
   None<br><br>
   
   Access Routine Semantics: <br>
   AI():<br>
   transition: Initializes reference to Sprite, x position y position and ID of AI, and this instance of handler  <br>
   tick():<br>
   transition: Allows game objects to be placed in game loop, and decides how to track ball to hit back to player controlled paddle <br>
   render():<br>
   transition: Will render object to screen <br>
   getBounds():<br>
   transition: Gets bounds of the AI paddle to set up for collision <br>
